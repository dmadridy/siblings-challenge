## Tech Stack

## Technical Decisions

### State Management

The application currently doesn't implement any global state management library (like Zustand) since:

- All state is handled locally within components
- No complex state sharing between components is required
- Props drilling is minimal
- Context API is sufficient for theme management

### Testing

Test coverage was not implemented in this phase due to:

- Time constraints in initial development
- Focus on core functionality and UI implementation
